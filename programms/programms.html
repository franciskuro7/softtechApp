    <!-- Advantages of Website Landing Page Template
Consistency: Using website landing page templates ensures consistency across all pages of the site. This makes it easier for visitors to navigate and find what they are looking for.
Saves Time: Instead of designing a landing page from scratch, using a template saves time as it's already set up and ready to go. This allows more time to focus on other aspects of the website.
Saves Money: Custom designed landing pages can be expensive. A template is usually much cheaper and still provides a professional look for the website.
Action-Oriented: Landing page templates are designed with specific goals in mind such as generating leads or making sales. They typically include built-in call-to-actions, which guide visitors towards completing a desired action.
Flexibility: Website landing page templates come in different styles, layouts, and designs, providing flexibility to choose one that fits your needs and brand image. It's also easy to make minor changes such as updating copy or images without having to start from scratch. -->
